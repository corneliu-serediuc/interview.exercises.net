Key Artifacts in Solution Design Documents

1. Solution Overview:

Purpose: High-level summary of the solution, including its goals, scope, and intended outcomes.
Context Diagram: Depicts the overall system and its interaction with external entities (users, systems, third-party services).

2. Functional Requirements:

Description: Detailed list of features and functionalities the solution must deliver.
Use Cases/User Stories: Scenarios illustrating how users will interact with the system.
Acceptance Criteria: Conditions under which the requirements are considered satisfied.

3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):

Performance: Expected response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
Scalability: Capacity to handle growth in users, data, or transactions.
Security: Authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance standards.
Availability & Reliability: Uptime targets, disaster recovery, and fault tolerance.

4. System Architecture:

High-Level Architecture Diagram: A visual representation of the system components, their interactions, and data flow.
Technology Stack: Details of the programming languages, frameworks, tools, and platforms being used.

5. Data Architecture:

Data Model: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or schema designs for databases.
Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs): How data moves between components within the system.
Integration Points: Description of APIs, message queues, or data pipelines.

6. Component Design:

Detailed Diagrams: Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, or deployment diagrams showing component interactions.
Component Responsibilities: Functions and interfaces for each component/module.
Service Contracts: API specifications (e.g., REST/GraphQL endpoints, input/output schemas).

7. Integration Design:

Integration Points: Details of external systems and their interfaces.
Protocol/Standards: Use of SOAP, REST, JSON, XML, or other standards.
Error Handling: How integration failures are detected, logged, and resolved.

8. Infrastructure Design:

Deployment Diagram: How the solution will be hosted, including cloud/on-premises, regions, and availability zones.
CI/CD Pipeline: Steps for continuous integration and deployment.
Monitoring/Logging: Tools and metrics for observing system health and performance.
Security Architecture:

9. Threat Model: Analysis of potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
Authentication/Authorization: Mechanisms like OAuth, SAML, or OpenID.
Data Encryption: Methods for securing data at rest and in transit.

10. Risks and Assumptions:

Risks: Potential challenges or limitations of the solution and strategies to mitigate them.
Assumptions: Preconditions assumed to be true for the solution design.

11. Compliance and Standards:

Industry Standards: PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, or other applicable compliance requirements.
Coding Standards: Guidelines for ensuring code quality and maintainability.

12. Implementation Roadmap:

Timeline: High-level project timeline or sprint plans.
Dependencies: List of critical dependencies on other teams, tools, or systems.

13. Glossary of Terms:

Definitions: Key terminology, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the design document.
